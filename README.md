## 📖 What Is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is a substitution cipher where each letter in the input text is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. It was famously used by Julius Caesar to protect military messages.

This program:
- Preserves uppercase and lowercase letters
- Leaves non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers) unchanged
- Allows the user to choose a shift key between `0` and `25`

**Example:**  
📝 Input: `Hello World`  
🔑 Shift key: `3`  
🔐 Output: `Khoor Zruog`
